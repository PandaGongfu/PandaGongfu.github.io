title: An analysis of human factors in Hollywood
---
## Project Description    
Hollywood is a complex human network. Producers, directors, writers, actors and cinematographers are working closely with each other to create movies. Their individual talents and the level of cooperation between them potentially have huge impacts on the outcome of movies.      
My analysis identifies the factors that have statistical significance and quantifies their impacts on the revenue and profitability of movies.

## Web Scraping
I scraped the data from [Box Office Mojo](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/). As a first time scraper, I definitely spent more than I'd expected. But I learned to add a random sleep time to reduce the probability of being denied of access.

## Feature Engineering
This is a crucial step in the modeling process. The quality of features is a decisive factor of the quality of your model.
The following features are created in this analysis:
- number of stars in the cast: ![star](../images/star.jpeg)    
  Cumulative box office gross for all actors in the database are calculated for a rolling 10-year period. If an actor is ranked in the top 100, then this person is deemed to be a star. For a specific movie, we look at the 10-year period ending in the year that's 2 years prior to its release year (assuming a 2-year production cycle on average) and count the number of stars in the cast (only the top 4 listed actors are considered).
- director score: ![star](../images/director.jpeg)  
  This is a measure based on the cumulative box office for the director in the same 10-year period.




- Clean up code for project 1.  
- Wrap up the coursera algo design course.  
- Understand regular expressions better.
