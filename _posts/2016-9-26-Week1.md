title: First week at Metis
---
First week at [Metis](http://www.thisismetis.com/) was in the book. I would say that it has matched my expectation so far and I'm glad that I made the decision to join. Our cohort comes from diverse backgrounds and it was a pleasure to have the opportunity to work with some of them on our first project.  
Our mornings started with pair programming exercises. The problems are not difficult but it's inspiring that the instructor would make us think about improve the complexity of our algorithms. This is something that I did not pay much attention before coming from a non-CS background. However, I believe it's critical to choose the blazingly fast algorithms when dealing with big data sets.  
The project took a major chunk of our time. I learned tremendous amount of knowledge from my teammates, such as the BeautifulSoup, sqlite3, seaborn python packages and Carto. I'm still working on understanding HDF data format and how it's related to the pandas panels.  
The lectures are fairly light on the first week and I hope it'll pick up pace in the coming weeks. Really looking forward to week 2. The to-do list includes:  
- Clean up code for project 1.  
- Wrap up the coursera algo design course.  
- Understand regular expressions better.
